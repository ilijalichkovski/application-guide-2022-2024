# UWC Macedonia Application Guide



Hi applicants!



This article serves to guide you through the application process for UWC Macedonia via the SurveyMonkey Application platform. Please ensure to familiarize yourself with this content as you're working on your application in order to avoid uncertainties and mistakes. For any questions or difficulties, feel free to email us at info@mk.uwc.org or contact us on Facebook ([UWC Macedonia](https://www.facebook.com/uwcmacedonia/)).

The deadline for applications is **November 20, 2021 at 23:59**. 

Best of luck with your application &mdash; we look forward to getting to know you better.



## Step 1: Registration

Click the following link to access the UWC Macedonia application: https://apply.uwc.org/prog/uwc_macedonia_application_national_committee_selection. 

In order to start your application, you need to register an account &mdash; you can do this by clicking the green *Register* button in the top right corner. Fill out the form, and upon registration, you will receive a confirmation email with instructions, which you need to follow in order to verify your email address. Without verifying your email address, you cannot submit the application or perform certain tasks, so ensure you do it before taking any other steps.

## Step 2: Eligibility Form

After your email verification is complete, you will be redirected to the page shown below. Click on the green **View Programs** box, and in the new page, click *Fill out eligibility profile*. This eligibility form is used by the system to verify which applications you can be considered for.

Start filling in the eligibility form with your **correct** personal information. It is extremely important that at least one of "Country of nationality" or "Country of residence" is set to Macedonia, as per your true status. Otherwise, the system will not consider you eligible for applying to UWC via the Macedonian National Committee, and you won't be able to access our application.

Next, ensure to select the **UWC National Committee** option as the application route &mdash; the Global Selection Programme is a different process and not relevant here.

Lastly, read the *UWC Data Protection Policy* and the *UWC Privacy Statement*, and upon doing so, tick the corresponding boxes. Complete the eligibility form by clicking **Save my Profile**.
